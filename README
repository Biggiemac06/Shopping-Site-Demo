I created a user interface to simulate a page where an admin can 
add, edit, or remove products in the product catalog.  Then you 
can switch to a page which simulates the shopping page a shopper would see.  
On the shopping page the user can select the products they want
by setting the quantity value for the product and then they can hit
the purchase button.  The purchase button will then allow a user to review
what they want to buy and they can enter important information to complete 
their purchase.
